# execvar
Test C program that counts the number of times it has been executed without using extra files by editing its own executable.

I consider the code straightforward enough not to risk offending any advanced programmers by documenting it.

**Note:** This program was **not** designed to support multiple architectures, operating systems, or executable formats. It was made solely for testing purposes. Therefore, the only machine it has been tested on is my own (gcc, ELF64, Manjaro Linux, Intel, little endian, etc. etc. etc.). Sorry!
